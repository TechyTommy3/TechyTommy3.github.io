		<p id="letter" class="comicsans">Dear Dico,</br>I bought Dico Theme Pack! It's the <s>worst</s> best $300 billion I have ever spent! It's really cool you beaded it together! <s>But it was poorly beaded.</s> I <span class="nes">didn't</span> regret<s>ted</s> it! <s>You should stop selling it!</s> This is the <s>most</s> <span class="nes">least</span> money I have spent on a single product! This is heavily <s>over</s><span class="nes">under</span>priced! I want <s>my money back</s><span class="nes">to give you more money</span>! <span class="nes">You should buy it today, and use code SHARKIEMAIL to get 50% above!</span></br>-Sharkie</p>
